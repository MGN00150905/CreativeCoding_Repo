In this chapter I will cover the most basic building block for programming motion - Vectors.

I will start with the basics and then leap into the complexity of vectors. How we can incorperate our mover class with using vectors. 

A vector is typically drawn as an arrow, the direction is indicated by where the arrow is pointing, and the magnitude by the length of the arrow itself.
