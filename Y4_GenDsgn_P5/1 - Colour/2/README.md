COLOUR SPECTRUM IN A GRID

In this sketch we generate a large amount of coloured tiles.
Each tile is assigned a hue and saturation value.
Hue on the horizontal axis and saturation the other.
The main colours in the spectrum can be seen more clearly
by enlarging the rectangles.

Width is being passed as the parameter HUE
Height is being passed as the parameter Saturation
```js

  var stepX;
  var stepY;

  function setup() {
    createCanvas(800, 400);
    noStroke();
    colorMode(HSB, width, height, 100);
  }

```
StepX and StepY are assigned to the X and Y movements of the mouse.

This grid of colours is generated by two for loops that are nested together.

The outer loop increases/decreases the amount of rectangles in the y position depending
on where the mouse is. While the inner loop does the same for rectangles in the x position

The hue of each rectangle is determined by gridX and saturation is determined by gridY
```js
    function draw() {
      stepX = mouseX + 3;
      stepY = mouseY + 3;
    for (var gridY = 0; gridY < height; gridY += stepY) {
      for (var gridX = 0; gridX < width; gridX += stepX) {
        fill(gridX, height - gridY, 100);
        rect(gridX, gridY, stepX, stepY);
      }
    }
  }
```
To save a PNG screenshot of the work in action we use the following code
We can save it by pressing s OR S.

```js

  function keyPressed() {
    if (key == 's' || key == 'S') saveCanvas(gd.timestamp(), 'png');
  }

```
